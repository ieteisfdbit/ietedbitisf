                <b>IETE MUMBAI ‘OSCILLATIONS 2017’ VALEDICTORY PROGRAMME</b><br>
                The Valedictory programme of IETE Mumbai Oscillations 2017 was conducted at Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai on 3rd April 2017, Monday from 3-5 PM. The event was organized to felicitate the winners of various events held at the ISF’s of IETE Mumbai spread across different engineering colleges in Mumbai under the banner of Oscillations 2017 in the month of February-March 2017. The event started with the welcome address by Prof. Lakshmi V. All the guests on the dais were felicitated by the ISF volunteers of DBIT. This was followed by the lighting of the lamp by the dignitaries. A valedictory talk was given by Dr. Sudhakar Mande, HoD, DBIT EXTC and Chairman, Navi Mumbai Chapter. The chief guest Dr. J W Bakal gave the keynote address wherein he stressed on the importance of technical student bodies and gave an insight into his experiences in the field of science and technology. The report of Oscillations 2017 was read by Dr. Tanuja Sarode, Treasurer,IETE Mumbai. After this talk, a small video was presented by IETE DBIT ISF showcasing the various initiatives of the ISF in terms of workshops and competitions held in the current academic semester. A wrist band of IETE DBIT ISF was released on the occasion and all the EC members of IETE Mumbai were presented with the same as a token of gratitude by IETE DBIT ISF. The winners of the competitions held at various ISF’s held under the banner of Oscillations 2017 were then felicitated. Trophies and certificates were given to the first and second prize winners of all the ISF’s. Participation certificates were also given to all the participants of the various competitions held individually at the ISFs. The programme ended with the vote of thanks by Mr. Melroy Cordeiro, Chairperson, IETE DBIT ISF Refreshments were arranged for the guests and all the students who participated.<br>

                <b>Circuit Simulation and PCB designing Workshop</b><br>
                The various options and tools available in the software were explained which was followed by the explanation of the finding and placing the components in the workspace and connecting it with the wires (net). The layout for a Voltage divider BJT amplifier circuit with bypassed emitter was explained and designed. The participants were explained how to simulate any analog and digital circuits using a circuit simulator software. The part of plotting the frequency response for the same circuit using the frequency response option available in the graph mode of the software was explained. Then, a digital circuit showing interfacing of priority encoder and 7 segment display was simulated. The participants were then asked to simulate a 4:1 MUX circuit on the simulator.The demonstration for printing the layout designed on the software on the copper clad board using heat transfer technique was given. First, the PCB was cleaned using acetone and scrubber and then the layout was printed on board using iron. The board was put in Ferrous chloride solution for etching process. Then drilling was done and components were mounted. After that the components were soldered followed by testing of the circuit.  <br>
